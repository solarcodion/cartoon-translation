# Background Chapter Analysis

## Overview

The Background Chapter Analysis feature automatically triggers AI-powered chapter analysis whenever pages are added, updated, or deleted. This ensures that chapter context is always up-to-date and reflects the current state of the chapter content.

## How It Works

### Automatic Triggers

The system automatically triggers chapter analysis in the following scenarios:

1. **Page Creation** (`POST /api/pages/`)

   - When a new page is uploaded to a chapter
   - Page operation completes immediately
   - Analysis runs in the background after successful page creation

2. **Page Update** (`PUT /api/pages/{page_id}`)

   - When page metadata or context is updated
   - Page operation completes immediately
   - Analysis runs in the background after successful page update

3. **Page Deletion** (`DELETE /api/pages/{page_id}`)
   - When a page is removed from a chapter
   - Page operation completes immediately
   - Analysis runs in the background after successful page deletion

### Chapter Status Workflow

The system automatically manages chapter status based on page count and analysis state:

1. **DRAFT** (`draft`)

   - When page count is 0
   - No pages in the chapter

2. **IN_PROGRESS** (`in_progress`)

   - When page count > 0 and analysis is running
   - Set immediately when pages are added/updated
   - Maintained during analysis process

3. **TRANSLATED** (`translated`)
   - When analysis completes successfully
   - Chapter context has been generated
   - Ready for translation work

### Background Processing

- **Non-blocking**: Page operations complete immediately (1-2 seconds)
- **Asynchronous**: Analysis happens in background (10-30 seconds)
- **Status tracking**: Chapter status reflects current analysis state
- **Error-tolerant**: Page operations succeed even if analysis fails
- **Automatic updates**: Chapter context and status updated automatically

## Implementation Details

### Background Task Function

```python
async def trigger_chapter_analysis_background(
    chapter_id: str,
    page_service: PageService,
    analysis_service: ChapterAnalysisService
):
    """Background task to analyze chapter after page changes"""
```

**Process:**

1. Updates chapter page count and sets status to IN_PROGRESS
2. Fetches all pages for the chapter
3. Sorts pages by page number (1, 2, 3, ...)
4. Prepares analysis request with page data and OCR contexts
5. Performs AI analysis using OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
6. Updates chapter context and sets status to TRANSLATED
7. On error: keeps status as IN_PROGRESS

### Default Translation Guidelines

The background analysis uses these default translation guidelines:

```python
translation_info = [
    "Maintain natural Vietnamese flow and readability",
    "Preserve character names and proper nouns",
    "Adapt cultural references appropriately",
    "Use appropriate Vietnamese honorifics and speech patterns"
]
```

### Error Handling

- **Graceful degradation**: Page operations succeed even if analysis fails
- **Comprehensive logging**: All analysis steps are logged for debugging
- **No exceptions propagated**: Background task errors don't affect API responses

## Benefits

### For Users

- **Always up-to-date context**: Chapter context reflects current page content
- **Seamless experience**: No manual analysis required
- **Immediate feedback**: Page operations complete instantly
- **Status visibility**: Chapter status shows analysis progress (draft/in_progress/translated)

### For Translators

- **Comprehensive context**: AI-generated context explains chapter story and themes
- **Consistent analysis**: Same analysis quality for all chapters
- **Translation guidance**: Context provides valuable information for translation work

## Performance Considerations

### Background Processing

- **Non-blocking**: Page uploads/updates complete in ~1-2 seconds
- **Analysis time**: Background analysis takes 10-30 seconds depending on chapter length
- **Resource usage**: Analysis runs separately from main API operations

### Optimization Features

- **Smart triggering**: Only analyzes when pages actually change
- **Efficient data fetching**: Fetches only necessary page data
- **Caching**: Analysis results are stored in database for future reference

## Monitoring and Logging

### Log Messages

**Analysis Start:**

```
üîÑ Triggering background chapter analysis for chapter {chapter_id}
üîÑ Starting background chapter analysis for chapter {chapter_id}
```

**Analysis Progress:**

```
üîÑ Analyzing chapter with {page_count} pages...
üìù Translation info: {rule_count} rules
üìö Existing context: Yes/No
```

**Analysis Completion:**

```
‚úÖ Background chapter analysis completed for chapter {chapter_id}
üìä Generated context: {character_count} characters
‚è±Ô∏è Processing time: {time}s
üéØ Chapter status set to TRANSLATED
```

**Status Updates:**

```
‚úÖ Updated chapter {chapter_id}: page_count={count}, status={status}
üìä Setting chapter {chapter_id} status to IN_PROGRESS
```

**Error Handling:**

```
‚ùå Error in background chapter analysis for chapter {chapter_id}: {error}
```

### Health Monitoring

Monitor these aspects for system health:

1. **Analysis Success Rate**: Track successful vs failed analyses
2. **Processing Time**: Monitor analysis duration trends
3. **Error Patterns**: Identify common failure scenarios
4. **Resource Usage**: Monitor OpenAI API token consumption

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The background analysis uses the same configuration as the main analysis API:

```env
# OpenAI Configuration
***REMOVED***your_openai_api_key_here
TRANSLATION_TARGET_LANGUAGE=Vietnamese
```

### Customization

To customize the default translation guidelines, modify the `trigger_chapter_analysis_background` function in `app/routers/pages.py`:

```python
translation_info = [
    "Your custom translation guideline 1",
    "Your custom translation guideline 2",
    # Add more guidelines as needed
]
```

## API Response Changes

### Page Creation Response

```json
{
  "id": "page-uuid",
  "chapter_id": "chapter-uuid",
  "page_number": 1,
  "file_path": "https://storage.url/page.jpg",
  "context": "OCR extracted text",
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

**Note**: The response is returned immediately. Chapter analysis happens in the background and updates the chapter context separately.

### Chapter Context Updates

After background analysis completes, the chapter's context field is automatically updated:

```json
{
  "id": "chapter-uuid",
  "context": "AI-generated comprehensive chapter context...",
  "updated_at": "2024-01-01T00:05:00Z"
}
```

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Monitor logs**: Watch for analysis errors and performance issues
2. **Handle gracefully**: Don't depend on immediate context updates
3. **Test thoroughly**: Verify background tasks work in your environment

### For Users

1. **Wait for analysis**: Allow 10-30 seconds for context to update after page changes
2. **Check context**: Refresh chapter data to see updated analysis results
3. **Report issues**: Monitor for analysis failures and report problems

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Analysis not triggering:**

- Check OpenAI API key configuration
- Verify background task system is working
- Check server logs for errors

**Analysis failing:**

- Verify OpenAI API quota and rate limits
- Check page data integrity (valid URLs, OCR contexts)
- Monitor network connectivity to OpenAI

**Context not updating:**

- Verify database write permissions
- Check chapter service functionality
- Monitor for service errors in logs

### Debug Commands

Test background analysis manually:

```python
from app.routers.pages import trigger_chapter_analysis_background
await trigger_chapter_analysis_background(chapter_id, page_service, analysis_service)
```
