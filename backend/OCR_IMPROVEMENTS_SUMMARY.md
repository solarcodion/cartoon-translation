# OCR Context Separation Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the OCR service to provide better context separation accuracy by reducing distance thresholds and improving text grouping logic. These improvements ensure that text parts are more accurately separated into distinct contexts, capturing all relevant content while preventing over-grouping.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Reduced Distance Thresholds
**Previous vs New Values:**
- `max_horizontal_gap_pixels`: 50 → 25 (50% reduction)
- `max_vertical_gap_pixels`: 30 → 15 (50% reduction)
- `max_horizontal_gap_multiplier`: 1.5 → 0.8 (47% reduction)
- `max_vertical_gap_multiplier`: 1.2 → 0.6 (50% reduction)

### 2. More Restrictive Same-Line Detection
- `same_line_vertical_threshold`: 0.3 → 0.2 (33% reduction)
- `same_line_horizontal_gap_multiplier`: 1.5 → 0.8 (47% reduction)

### 3. Enhanced Vertical Stacking Detection
- `vertical_stack_horizontal_threshold`: 0.5 → 0.3 (40% reduction)
- `vertical_stack_gap_multiplier`: 1.0 → 0.5 (50% reduction)

### 4. Stricter Nearby Text Detection
- `nearby_vertical_threshold`: 0.8 → 0.4 (50% reduction)
- `nearby_horizontal_threshold`: 1.2 → 0.6 (50% reduction)
- `nearby_gap_multiplier`: 0.8 → 0.4 (50% reduction)

### 5. Enhanced Text Box Filtering
**New Parameters:**
- `min_text_box_area`: 20 (minimum area to consider)
- `min_text_length`: 1 (minimum text length)
- `confidence_boost_threshold`: 0.8 (boost inclusion for high-confidence text)

**Improved Logic:**
- More inclusive filtering to capture small but relevant text
- High-confidence text gets priority even if small
- Better noise reduction while preserving content

### 6. Enhanced Grouping Algorithm
**Key Changes:**
- Uses minimum dimensions instead of averages for more restrictive grouping
- Prioritizes actual overlap detection
- More conservative distance calculations
- Enhanced edge-to-edge distance calculations

### 7. Improved Text Merging Logic
**Spacing Improvements:**
- Vertical gap threshold for new lines: 0.5 → 0.3 (40% reduction)
- Same-line detection threshold: 0.3 → 0.15 (50% reduction)
- Small vertical gap threshold: 0.1 → 0.05 (50% reduction)
- More intelligent spacing based on both vertical and horizontal gaps

## New API Endpoints

### 1. Update Configuration
```
POST /api/ocr/text-grouping-config
```
Update specific grouping parameters with enhanced options.

### 2. Reset to Defaults
```
POST /api/ocr/text-grouping-config/reset
```
Reset all parameters to optimized defaults.

### 3. Get Current Configuration
```
GET /api/ocr/text-grouping-config
```
Retrieve current configuration with parameter descriptions.

## Configuration Methods

### Runtime Configuration
```python
ocr_service.configure_text_grouping(
    max_horizontal_gap_pixels=20,
    max_vertical_gap_pixels=10,
    same_line_vertical_threshold=0.15
)
```

### Reset to Defaults
```python
ocr_service.reset_grouping_config()
```

### Get Current Config
```python
config = ocr_service.get_text_grouping_config()
```

## Expected Results

### Before Improvements
- Text from different contexts often grouped together
- Some small text parts missed due to restrictive filtering
- Less accurate separation in complex layouts

### After Improvements
- Better separation of distinct text contexts
- More accurate capture of all relevant text content
- Improved handling of manga/comic text patterns
- Reduced false grouping of distant text elements

## Debug Information
The service now provides detailed logging:
- Input text boxes count
- Output grouped regions count
- Average texts per region ratio

## Testing
All improvements have been tested with mock data to ensure:
- Correct grouping behavior for different text arrangements
- Proper handling of overlapping vs. distant text
- Accurate same-line and vertical stacking detection
- Enhanced filtering captures relevant content

## Backward Compatibility
All changes are backward compatible. Existing API endpoints continue to work with improved accuracy, and new configuration options are optional.
